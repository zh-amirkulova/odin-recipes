<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Pasta with shrimp is a delightful dish that combines tender pasta, such as spaghetti or linguine, with succulent, saut√©ed shrimp. The shrimp is often cooked in a light, flavorful sauce made with garlic, olive oil, and sometimes white wine or lemon juice. This sauce coats the pasta, infusing it with a rich, savory taste. Fresh herbs like parsley, and a hint of red pepper flakes for spice, can elevate the dish, while cherry tomatoes add a burst of color and sweetness. The result is a fresh, vibrant meal that's both satisfying and elegant.
