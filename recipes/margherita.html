    Pizza Margherita is a classic Italian dish known for its simplicity and fresh ingredients. It features a thin, crispy crust topped with a rich tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and vibrant basil leaves. The pizza is typically baked until the crust is golden and the cheese melts into a gooey, delicious layer. A drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt add the finishing touches, enhancing the natural flavors. This pizza is light, flavorful, and embodies the essence of Italian cuisine, showcasing the harmonious combination of just a few high-quality ingredients.
